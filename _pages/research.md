## COVID-19

I am currently developing short-term forecasts of Trust-level COVID-19 hospitalisations in the UK, as well as exploring methods for quantifying the delay between increases in COVID-19 community cases and hospitalisations. Within the [Epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/covid/) group, I have contributed to research on real-time inference of the time-varying reproduction number, and on the effect of the UK school-household network on COVID-19 transmission. I am also a member of the [CMMID COVID-19 working group](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/).

## Ebola

I worked on the 2018 -- 2020 North-Kivu and Ituri Ebola outbreak response for the World Health Organisation, in both Geneva and Goma, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

## Metapopulation dynamics of endemic diseases

As part of my PhD research, I explored the effect of metapopulation network structure on the dynamics of endemic diseases, specifically exploring the relationship between network structure and pairwise-correlation between outbreaks in two subpopulations.
